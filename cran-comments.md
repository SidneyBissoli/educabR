This is a new submission.

The package downloads data from INEP (Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais Anisio Teixeira), Brazil's national institute of educational studies and research. All data is publicly available.

Examples that download data are wrapped in `\dontrun{}` to avoid network requests during CRAN checks.
